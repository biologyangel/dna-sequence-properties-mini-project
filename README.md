## Simple Gene Data Analysis from Text File
A Python project using Biopython to analyze DNA sequences from a FASTA file.


This project involves reading, processing, and analyzing hypothetical gene property data stored in a simple text file. The Python script demonstrates foundational data handling skills, including reading structured data from a file, storing it in Python data structures, performing basic analyses, and writing processed data to a new output file. This project was developed as a hands-on exercise focusing on basic file I/O and data manipulation.


The script reads gene data (Gene ID, Gene Type, Length) from an input file. Analyses performed or enabled by this script include:

-   Reading tabular data row by row.
-   Parsing data fields based on a delimiter like tab or comma.
-   Storing data in Python data structures like lists of dictionaries.
-   Performing simple counts, for example, counting different gene types.
-   Filtering data based on criteria, for example, finding genes above a certain length.
-   Writing processed or summarized data to an output file.

## Tech Used

-   **Python:** The core programming language.
-   **Standard File Handling:** Using Python's built-in open() and file methods for reading and writing text files.
-   **Basic Data Structures:** Utilizing Lists and Dictionaries to organize and store the data read from the file.
-   **Control Flow:** Implementing loops and conditionals for data processing.
-   **Functions:** Using or defining functions for code modularity as the project progresses.
-   **Jupyter Notebook (Optional):** Can be developed and run within an interactive notebook environment.

This project helped me practice:

-   Reading structured data from plain text files.
-   Using Python's built-in file handling capabilities.
-   Parsing and cleaning data strings.
-   Storing data efficiently in lists and dictionaries.
-   Applying loops and conditionals to process data.
-   Writing results to output files.
-   Building foundational data analysis workflows in Python.
